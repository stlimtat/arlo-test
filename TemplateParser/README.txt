TemplateParser.csproj
---------------------

- Write your implementation in TemplateEngineImpl.cs so that it passes all of the tests in TemplateParser.Test
- To test your implementation, set TemplateParser.Test as the startup project, and use F5 to run its Main method.
- You may also use the integrated Test Explorer to run the tests within the IDE.
